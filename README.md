## About me

My name is Ev. I'm a Software Developer with background in sustainability consulting and marketing. Being primarily value-driven, I'm focusing on finding solutions to the challenges our society is facing. 

Technology plays a key role in the solution mix: from better informing our decision making process to directly helping us to reduce our impact on the environment. And as evidenced by the last couple of years, technology is essential in helping us to connect and making it easier for us to live fulfilling and impactful lives. 

Hence, I’m here, working towards a more sustainable future and, simply, having fun. :upside_down_face:

I have seven years’ experience in sustainable business consulting, project management and marketing within a range of industries, which enabled me to develop diverse skills in reporting, presenting and project-management. I also spent four years supporting people in adopting better meditation and mindfulness practices. Being able to understand what others might be experiencing, as well as my own reactions, makes me a flexible team player when working with internal or external stakeholders.

Multilingual MBA graduate, [On Purpose Fellow](https://onpurpose.org/en/) and, now, a [Maker](https://makers.tech/), I'm looking for new and exciting problem solving adventures for the challenges we are facing today and in future.
