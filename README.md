## About me

My name is Ev. I'm a Software Developer with a background in sustainability consulting and marketing. Being primarily value-driven, I'm focusing on finding solutions to the challenges our society is facing. 

Technology plays a key role in the solution mix: from better informing our decision making process to directly helping us to reduce our impact on the environment. And as evidenced by the last couple of years, technology is essential in helping us to connect and making it easier for us to live fulfilling and impactful lives. 

Hence, I’m here, working towards a more sustainable future and, simply, having fun. :upside_down_face:

I have seven years’ experience in sustainable business consulting, project management and marketing within a range of industries, which enabled me to develop diverse skills in project delivery, design of decision-making tools and frameworks, and reporting. I also spent four years supporting people in adopting better meditation and mindfulness practices. Being able to understand what others might be experiencing, as well as my own reactions, makes me a flexible team player when working with internal or external stakeholders.

Multilingual MBA graduate, [On Purpose Fellow](https://onpurpose.org/en/) and, now, a [Maker](https://makers.tech/), I'm looking for new and exciting real-life problem-solving adventures.

## Skills

#### Project management
As part of my career, I had an opportunity to manage projects for organisations of various sizes and different types. Each project involved detailed planning, breaking down activities into executable tasks, identifying interdependencies between these tasks, assigning them to internal and external stakeholders, and ensuring regular communications between the team members. Project plans had to be adapted regularly to reflect the execution of individual steps adn new information, which sometimes involved reallocation of resources and reviewing other delivery plans I was responsible for. 

My project management experience proved to be useful at the Makers, as I was able to easily familiarize myself with agile methodologies, such as Kanban board, user stories, ticketing and agile ceremonies, which we used to deliver our team projects. Being able to get used to agile methods quickly helped me to focus on my coding objectives and also offering better support to others if required.

#### Fast Learner
During our last two weeks at Makers, we had an opportunity to work on a project of our choice. My team got quite excited by the idea of creating a [mobile application](https://github.com/EvSivtsova/ratify) that allows owners of exotic pets, such as rats, to get faster access to information needed to take good care of the animals. We decided to use React Native as part of the MERN stack to create a user-friendly app on iOS and Android. None of us had any experience with React or React Native. So we had quite a lot of challenges ranging from setting up the project and building modular React components to connecting the front end and the back end of the app to ensure smooth and reliable data transfer. 

To familiarize myself with React syntax and React Native features, I used resources available on React Native website. I also made the most of online tutorials to practice basic concepts and read the developer documentation on MongoDB website and relevant React Native libraries. As a team, we shared the information we found useful and how we tackled some of the challenges we were facing. With additional support of Makers’ coaches, in under two weeks we managed to build a great-looking prototype of an app, which could be easily scaled up if required. Instead of having only a rat as our choice animal, we were able to add information on guinea pigs and tigers in one day only.

#### Team player
Throughout my career I had an opportunity to collaborate across multicultural cross-functional teams to ensure timely and on-budget execution of projects and tasks in Europe, North America, UAE, CIS countries and Asia. I worked successfully with remote and face-to-face team members to deliver the majority of my projects.

This experience was very helpful at Makers, as we paired every afternoon, mainly, remotely, to learn how to pair effectively. When working in teams, we also had regular Scrum meetings, during which I was making sure that we used our time wisely and ensured the clarity of the tasks discussed while also keeping it lighthearted and fun. I also took responsibility for some of the less popular tasks, such as setting up databases in all three team projects, including creating Many-to-Many relationships for an experimentary [AirBNB clone](https://github.com/EvSivtsova/makersbnb). In addition, I shared the information I found useful with my teammates. For example, having broken down the boilerplate we received for our [facebook clone](https://github.com/EvSivtsova/acebook-the-pyjamas), I explained to some of my teammates how middlewares work and how they can be used to check, for example, whether a user is authorized to use a specific route, and handle errors. I then used this knowledge to set up the project for our [Ratify](https://github.com/EvSivtsova/ratify) app.
