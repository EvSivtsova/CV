## About me

My name is Ev. I'm a Software Developer with a background in sustainability consulting and marketing. Being primarily value-driven, I'm focusing on finding solutions to the challenges our society is facing. 

Technology plays a key role in the solution mix: from better informing our decision making process to directly helping us to reduce our impact on the environment. And as evidenced by the last couple of years, technology is essential in helping us to connect and making it easier for us to live fulfilling and impactful lives. 

Hence, I’m here, working towards a more sustainable future and, simply, having fun. :upside_down_face:

I have seven years’ experience in sustainable business consulting, project management and marketing within a range of industries, which enabled me to develop diverse skills in reporting, presenting and project management. I also spent four years supporting people in adopting better meditation and mindfulness practices. Being able to understand what others might be experiencing, as well as my own reactions, makes me a flexible team player when working with internal or external stakeholders.

Multilingual MBA graduate, [On Purpose Fellow](https://onpurpose.org/en/) and, now, a [Maker](https://makers.tech/), I'm looking for new and exciting real-life problem-solving adventures.

## Skills

#### Project management
As part of my career, I had an opportunity to manage projects for organisations of various sizes and different types. Each project involved detailed planning, breaking down activities into executable tasks, identifying interdependencies between these tasks, assigning them to internal and external stakeholders, and ensuring that there are regular communications between myself and stakeholders. Often, I had to adapt the project plan depending on the execution of individual tasks. 

For example, I managed the delivery of a project for a large infrastructure organization. We were developing a framework, tools and metrics the company would use when selecting their suppliers based on sustainability performance. At the research stage, we discovered opportunities to bring additional value to the client. I reviewed our approach and our capacity to deliver, which involved adjusting the delivery of other team projects, renegotiated the costs with the client and secured their approval. As a result, we were able to deliver more value to the client, as well as building additional expertise within the team, and all of this while being on track with other projects that the team was undertaking at that time.

This experience proved to be useful at the Makers, as I was able to easily familiarize myself with agile methodologies, such as Kanban board, user stories, ticketing and agile ceremonies, to deliver our team projects. Being able to get used to agile methods quickly helped me to focus on my coding objectives and also better support others.

#### Team player
Throughout my career I collaborated across multicultural cross-functional teams to ensure timely and on-budget execution of projects and tasks in Europe, North America, UAE, CIS countries and Asia. I worked successfully with remote and face-to-face team members. As part of the delivery of the SEDA programme at Santander.....
At the Makers We had to work together, often remotely, to build functioning applications, while also learning programming languages. 

#### Fast Learner
During our last two weeks at Makers, we had an opportunity to work on a project of our choice. My team got quite excited by the idea of creating a mobile application that allows owners of exotic pets such as rats to find out safe foods, local vets, and upcoming animal events. We decided to use React Native as part of the MERN stack to create a user-friendly app on iOS and Android. None of us had any experience with React or React Native. So we had quite a lot of challenges from setting up the project and building modular React components to connecting the front end and the back end of the app to ensure smooth and reliable data transfer. 

To familiarize myself with React syntax and particularities of React Native, I used resources available on React Native website. I also used online tutorials to practice basic concepts and read the developer documentation on MongoDB website and relevant React Native libraries. As a team, we shared the information we found useful and how we tackled some of the challenges we were facing. With additional support of Makers’ coaches, in under two weeks we managed to build a great-looking prototype of an app, which could be easily scaled up if required. Instead of having only a rat as our choice animal, we were able to add information on guinea pigs and tigers in one day only.
